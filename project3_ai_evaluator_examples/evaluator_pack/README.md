# Evaluator Pack (v1)

This folder is a compact sample of the artifacts I would produce in an AI evaluator / rater workflow.
It demonstrates consistent scoring, concise justifications, and actionable improvement notes.

Suggested order:

1) `rubric_v1.md`  
2) `taxonomy_v1.md`  
3) `labeled_examples_v1.md`  
4) `evaluation_log.csv`
