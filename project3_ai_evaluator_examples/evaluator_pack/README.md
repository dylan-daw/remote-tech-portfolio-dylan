# Evaluator Pack (v1)

This folder is a compact sample of the artifacts I would produce in an AI evaluator / rater workflow.
It demonstrates consistent scoring, concise justifications, and actionable improvement notes.

Suggested order:

1. [Rubric (v1)](rubric_v1.md)
2. [Taxonomy (v1)](taxonomy_v1.md)
3. [Labeled examples (v1)](labeled_examples_v1.md)
4. [Evaluation log (CSV)](evaluation_log.csv)
