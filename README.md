# Remote Tech Portfolio – Dylan Daw

This repo contains small, focused projects that show the kinds of skills
I’d use in a remote technical role (Python, data analysis, testing, and
AI evaluation).

## Project 1 – Titanic Survival Analysis

Folder: `project1_titanic_analysis`

A Jupyter notebook that uses the classic Kaggle Titanic dataset to:

- Load and inspect real-world CSV data with pandas
- Do simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) with plots
- Clean and encode features
- Train and evaluate a baseline logistic regression model
- Visualize performance with a confusion matrix

Main file: `titanic_analysis.ipynb`

## Project 2 – Temperature Converter & Tests

Folder: `project2_temp_tests`

A tiny Python module plus tests that:

- Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Validate inputs
- Include a small `pytest` test suite

Main files:
- `temp_converter.py`
- `test_temp_converter.py`

## Project 3 – AI Evaluator Examples

Folder: `project3_ai_evaluator_examples`

A collection of examples showing how I would evaluate large language
model (LLM) answers:

- Example prompts and model answers
- Scoring with a simple rubric (accuracy, completeness, clarity, safety)
- Short written justifications and improved answer suggestions

Main file: `ai_evaluator_examples.md`

## Project 4 — Developer Documentation Sample (LLM Retrieval API)

A developer documentation writing sample showing:
- Quickstart + docs structure
- API reference (request/response examples)
- RAG tutorial (LLM + retrieval integration concepts)
- OpenAPI spec file
- Runnable mock server/client examples

Folder: `project4_developer_docs_sample`
Start here: `project4_developer_docs_sample/README.md`
